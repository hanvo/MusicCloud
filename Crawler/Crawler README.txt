It will run though a selected directory and obtain the following:
ID (just how many songs were inserted), 
Title, 
Absolute file path,
LengthofSong(Seconds),
Artist, 
Album, 
AlbumArt,

As it is crawling through the music folder it will insert all of it into a database. The database is stored locally on the server machine.
