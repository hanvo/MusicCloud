* Description
* Our project is a modern day dj. Our server will be connected to a database which will hold locations
* of music files that are stored locally on to a raspberry pi. The server will poll music suggestions and
* play the highest voted song. If there are no song suggestions it will shuffle through the music list and play a song.
* Clients can use the IOS app to connect to the raspberry pi's hosted website to submit song selections.
